          <h1>Profile</h1>
          <p>
            I am Zax.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a guy using he/him pronouns. I like making music, programming and designing electronics. I am constantly exploring new ideas and concepts. I consider myself to be a casual gamer, if a gamer at all.
          </p>
          <h3>Contact</h3>
          <h4>BEFORE YOU CONTACT ME</h4>
          <p>
            Understand boundaries. If you start asking personal stuff, trolling, or otherwise fucking around with me, you will be blocked. We all have our own lives and our own secrets. Let's keep it that way.
          </p>
          <h4>With that out of the way...</h4>
          <p>
            You can contact me over:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Discord (@zaxinothdigital)
              </li>
              <li>
                Email (me@zaxinoth.digital)
              </li>
              <li>
                XMPP (zaxinothdigital@disroot.org)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Email responses may be slow, and I may not even respond to XMPP at all (messages sometimes disappear). I check my Discord far more frequently.

          <h1>Computers</h1>
          <h3>The All-in-One</h3>
          <p>
            A Lenovo computer, was my first computer. Now owned by my parents.
          </p>
          <h3>The Dell</h3>
          <p>
            A Dell Inspiron 3020. It is my second PC. It has:
            <ul>
              <li>
                16 threads. This comes from 6 dual-thread cores and 4 single-thread cores. These have gotten me through many a <code>make -j16</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Integrated graphics. These have gotten me through basic stuff, and as I don't do any extreme gaming, I have not bothered to improve on this.
              </li>
              <li>
                A 1TB hard drive. Still spinning today, contains about 100GB of stuff on it. It greets me with a quiet buzzing every time the computer powers on.
              </li>
              <li>
                A DVD burn tray. I have burned and ruined countless CD-Rs with it. Currently I have a CD copy of Minecraft: Volume Alpha on a yellow Memorex disc.
              </li>
              <li>
                A random Acer monitor. This monitor only takes HDMI and VGA. This computer had no chance of having 2 monitors anyways.
              </li>
              <li>
                A set of Creative Gigaworks T40 speakers. Surprisingly kick-ass. They have survived the loudest song I own through my phone and bluetooth to line adapter, with all 3 at full volume.
              </li>
              <li>
                Standard Dell keyboard and mouse. Extremely dirty from a singular year of use.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>The Chromebook</h3>
          <p>
            
            One of if not the worst devices I have ever owned. It's practically useless, although it has a few neat features:
            <ul>
              <li>
                8 cores ARM. While ARM sucks, having 8 cores is still nice. It has been used through many a <code>make -j8</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Weird resolution screen. I don't remember what resolution it was. I just remember it being a weird one. It also has almost an inch of bezel on all sides, except the bottom, which has almost 2 inches.
              </li>
              <li>
                Singular charging port and USB-A port. This is not enough ports. Why did I buy this thing?
              </li>
              <li>
                360 hinge. This thing went wobbly after the 3 years that I have used it for.
              </li>
              <li>
                Terrible tablet mode. While the browser works beautifully in tablet mode, Android apps frequently beg you to restart them if the resoluton changes slightly (which it does in Tablet mode). Once played Mario Kart Tour in this mode.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>
            The Laptop
          </h3>
          <p>
            A Lenovo Yoga of some kind. Has these features:
            <ul>
              <li>
                A number pad. While slightly narrower than a normal numpad, it comes in handy at times.
              </li>
              <li>
                That shitty Copilot key. I keep accidentally hitting this key, completely halting my workflow as a new window opens up that I have to close because it's in my way. Replaced the right Ctrl key. What if I needed the right Ctrl key, <i>Microshaft</i>?
              </li>
              <li>
                A 16:10 screen. What would normally be 1920x1080 has become 1920x1200. Slightly taller screen is kind of nice. I don't have much to say about it.
              </li>
              <li>
                An absolutely gimongous touchpad. Easily configurable in Windows settings. Default behavior is not great, but the ability to turn off the right click in the corner is nice, as this usually just gets in my way. Has sensitivity controls. I have yet to use these. One complaint I have is that it's so big that my palm triggers it, accidentally right clicking or middle clicking due to the presence of an extra "finger".
              </li>
              <li>
                Nice default desktop background. I've noticed that Lenovo has always had some kind of custom background, at least since Windows 10 when I first saw their abstract rainbow background.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>
            The Raspberry Pi
          </h3>
          <p>
            Purchased on Amazon for far greater than MSRP. I have used it for Minecraft (laggy and gets hot), web hosting, and other shenanigans, usually involving the network. It is a Pi 4B 8GB. One major complaint I have is the use of Micro HDMI. It is fragile and finnicky. Otherwise a useful thing to have around.

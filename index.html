    <h3>The Name</h3>
    <p>
      OK, so this is kind of a long story, but I'll tell it anyway.
    </p>
    <h4>pincesCPU987/pincesCPU456</h4>
    <h6>This one is a doozy.</h6>
    <p>
      Back in grade school, I was part of a school district that had emails assigned to a certain format.
      My email ended up starting with "pinces", so I decided to incorporate that as well as the acronym "CPU" into my username for Scratch, a block coding website.
      I then wanted to add numbers, but I didn't want "123", so I picked "987".
      I later wanted to create a new Scratch account, so I picked "456" instead, and that became my most active account to date.
      After I created those accounts, I created my first and only GitHub account. Same name, with the 987 version.
      These accounts were not associated with any one profile picture, and I rarely ever use Scratch anymore.
    </p>
    <h4>KirboCrafter39</h4>
    <h6>:KirbyJamming:</h6>
    <p>
      This was the longest standing account name as of June 2025.
      I decided to come up with a Kirby-related username because I was obsessed with <i>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</i> at the time.
      The "Crafter" part was due to my other obsession with Minecraft.
    </p>
    <h4>Zaxinoth Digital (current)</h4>
    <h6><i>"very badass name"</i> - Flaminglog</h6>
    <p>
      This username was created during a deep thought session of names that have a Z and an X in them.
      I Googled names until I found one that didn't exist.
      After I found this name, I made several variations of my logo until sticking with a cube with the initials "ZD" on it.
